This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an element in an array that is outside its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error is due to incorrect array indexing. Perl arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0. Attempting to access an index beyond the last element's index results in undefined behavior.
